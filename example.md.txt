PURPOSE
=======

The purposes of this test method are:

#.  Introduce the Markdown syntax.

#.  Demonstrate conversion to PDF.

#.  Show how Github can be used to effectively collaborate. 

BACKGROUND
==========

Markdown formatting was created as a way to specify document structure using a
simple syntax for document features. This is in contrast to mark-up formats such
as HTML or LaTex which require a more extensive knowledge to format documents
properly and are not as human readable.

SYNTAX
======

Sections
--------

Section headers are created by either placing # characters on the same line or =
characters under the heading:

    SYNTAX
    ======

or 

    # SYNTAX

Subsections can be created using multiple # characters or - characters:

    Sections
    --------

or 

    ## Sections

Lists
-----

Another feature that is very useful are nested (enumerated) lists. For example:

#.  Item 1
    #.  subitem 1.1
    #.  subitem 1.2
#.  Item 2
    #.  subitem 2.1
    
The above list was created with the following syntax. Note that the list is
autonumbered based on section number, but this is *somewhat* configurable.

    #.  Item 1
        #.  subitem 1.1
        #.  subitem 1.2
    #.  Item 2
        #.  subitem 2.1
        
Highlighting
------------

Items can be *italicized* or **bolded** using a very simple syntax:

    *italicized*
    **bolded**
    
CONVERSION
==========

The open source program "pandoc" can convert from several text formatting
styles, including Markdown and \LaTeX, and output several other formats such as
HTML, PDF, and DOCX. 

It was most straight-forward to use pandoc to convert to PDF, which goes through
a \LaTeX\ intermediate file. *I did not explore any other formats, except
briefly for DOCX which seemed harder to customize.* 

Conversion from Markdown to PDF requires "pdflatex" to be properly installed.
\LaTeX\ to PDF has the advantage that customizing a template file is often all
that is needed and can incorporate \LaTeX\ math or other commands with little
effort. For example:

$\int x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C$

or

\begin{equation}
\int x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C
\end{equation}

GITHUB COLLABORATION
====================

This next part is harder to show in a document, so a example Github repo has
been created.
